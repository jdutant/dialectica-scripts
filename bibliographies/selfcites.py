"""
Dialectica open access initiative self-citing bibliography file check, (c) Thomas Hodgson 2021
MIT License

The script takes paths as arguments. The assumption is that these are biblatex files.
It looks for biblatex cite commands, and compares these to the biblatex entries in the files.
The following will be printed:

- the keys used in citation commands (if any)
- the missing keys that are not entries (if any)
- the entries in the file

If the option --source argument is given, the script tries to use bibtexparser to make an extended
biblatex file with missing entries added from the argument to --source. The new file will have value
of the optional argument --suffix added to the name of the original file.
The default value of --suffix is '_extended'.

Dependencies:

- argparse
- os
- re
- bibtexparser
